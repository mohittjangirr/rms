// This is a simplified example. You should implement proper security measures and error handling in a real-world application.

// Assuming you have a database connection established in config.php
include('includes/config.php');

// Retrieve the received face descriptor from the POST request
$receivedFaceDescriptor = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);

// Assuming you have a table named 'users' where you store user information including face descriptors
// Adjust the query and table name according to your database structure
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users";
$query = $dbh->prepare($sql);
$query->execute();
$users = $query->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

// Loop through each user and compare their face descriptors with the received one
foreach ($users as $user) {
    // Assuming the face descriptors are stored as JSON strings in the database
    $storedFaceDescriptor = json_decode($user['face_descriptor'], true);

    // Compare the received face descriptor with the stored one
    // You may need to use a suitable comparison method based on your face recognition library
    if (compareFaceDescriptors($receivedFaceDescriptor, $storedFaceDescriptor)) {
        // Authentication successful
        $response = array('success' => true);
        echo json_encode($response);
        exit;
    }
}

// If no match is found, authentication fails
$response = array('success' => false);
echo json_encode($response);

// Function to compare face descriptors
function compareFaceDescriptors($descriptor1, $descriptor2) {
    // Implement your comparison logic here
    // For example, you may calculate the Euclidean distance between the descriptors and check if it's below a certain threshold
    // This depends on the format and structure of your face descriptors and the requirements of your face recognition library
    // You'll need to adapt this function according to your specific implementation
    // This is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual comparison logic
    // Example:
    // $distance = calculateEuclideanDistance($descriptor1, $descriptor2);
    // return $distance < $threshold;
}
